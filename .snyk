    - "*":
        reason: >-
          minimatch@3.1.2 ReDoS: all usages are with hardcoded/trusted input.
          swagger-jsdoc uses glob patterns from source code; sqlite3 uses
          node-gyp glob patterns during native addon compilation. Untrusted
          user input never reaches minimatch. The only fixed version (>=10.2.1)
          is API-incompatible with glob@7 (minimatch 10 CJS export is an
          object, not a function). Will re-evaluate when upstream deps migrate
          to glob@10+ or when minimatch backports a fix to 3.x-9.x.

  SNYK-JS-AJV-15274295:
    - "*":
        reason: >-
          ajv <8.18.0 ReDoS via $data option. eslint 10 hard-pins ajv@^6.12.4
          and is API-incompatible with ajv 8 (removed draft-04 schema refs,
          changed constructor options). eslint uses ajv only for config schema
          validation with trusted input — not exploitable. Will re-evaluate
          when eslint migrates to ajv 8.
