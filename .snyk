  SNYK-JS-MINIMATCH-15309438:
    - "swagger-jsdoc > glob > minimatch":
        reason: >-
          glob patterns passed to swagger-jsdoc are hardcoded route paths in
          source code. Untrusted user input never reaches minimatch. The only
          fixed version (>=10.2.1) is API-incompatible with glob@7 used by
          swagger-jsdoc@6.2.8 (minimatch 10 CJS export is an object, not a
          function). Will re-evaluate when swagger-jsdoc releases a version
          using glob@10+ or when minimatch backports a fix to 3.x-9.x.

  SNYK-JS-AJV-15274295:
    - "eslint > ajv":
        reason: >-
          ajv <8.18.0 ReDoS via $data option. eslint 10 hard-pins ajv@^6.12.4
          and is API-incompatible with ajv 8 (removed draft-04 schema refs,
          changed constructor options). eslint uses ajv only for config schema
          validation with trusted input — not exploitable. Will re-evaluate
          when eslint migrates to ajv 8.
