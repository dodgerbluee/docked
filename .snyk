  SNYK-JS-MINIMATCH-15309438:
    - "swagger-jsdoc > glob > minimatch":
        reason: >-
          glob patterns passed to swagger-jsdoc are hardcoded route paths in
          source code. Untrusted user input never reaches minimatch. The only
          fixed version (>=10.2.1) is API-incompatible with glob@7 used by
          swagger-jsdoc@6.2.8 (minimatch 10 CJS export is an object, not a
          function). Will re-evaluate when swagger-jsdoc releases a version
          using glob@10+ or when minimatch backports a fix to 3.x-9.x.
