| **Architecture & Design**            | Modular batch system structure    | Clear, modular architecture: batch manager, job handlers, scheduler, logger separated with clean interfaces              | Minor mixing of concerns; modules mostly separated           | Modules are tightly coupled; difficult to extend         | No clear separation; monolithic and hard to maintain |
|                                      | Extensibility for new batch types | Adding a new batch type requires only implementing a handler interface and updating config; no core logic changes        | Some changes required in core logic                          | Adding batch types requires major rewrites               | Cannot add batch types without full system rewrite   |
|                                      | Configurable intervals            | Intervals are fully dynamic, per batch type, changeable via API without restart                                          | Intervals mostly configurable; some require server restart   | Intervals fixed; require code changes                    | No configurability; hard-coded intervals             |
| **Backend Implementation (Node.js)** | Decoupled execution               | Batch jobs run entirely in backend; frontend only retrieves status/results                                               | Mostly decoupled; some frontend dependencies                 | Partial backend execution; significant frontend reliance | Frontend directly triggers or blocks batch execution |
|                                      | Scheduler robustness              | Supports cron-like intervals, retries, error handling, concurrent execution without collisions                           | Supports intervals and retries, minor concurrency issues     | Basic scheduling only; limited error handling            | No scheduler; runs only manually or synchronously    |
|                                      | Logging & Monitoring              | Structured logs with timestamps, batch type, status, errors; supports querying and monitoring                            | Logs exist but partially structured or missing key info      | Minimal logging; hard to query                           | No logging                                           |
|                                      | Error Handling & Recovery         | Handles errors per batch, retries intelligently, maintains system stability                                              | Handles errors with partial recovery                         | Error handling exists but may crash system               | No error handling; failures crash system             |
| **Frontend Integration (React)**     | Status Display                    | Displays batch execution details in real-time (last run, next run, success/fail, logs) without impacting batch execution | Status mostly displayed; minor lag or missing info           | Partial status info; updates require page refresh        | No execution details displayed                       |
|                                      | Config Management UI              | Fully dynamic forms for editing batch intervals and settings, validated, persisted via API                               | UI mostly functional; minor validation or persistence issues | UI present but hard-coded or not fully functional        | No UI; cannot manage batch settings                  |
| **Code Quality & Best Practices**    | Readability                       | Clean, well-documented code, consistent naming, clear separation of concerns                                             | Mostly readable; minor inconsistencies                       | Code is cluttered; hard to follow                        | Code is unreadable; spaghetti code                   |
|                                      | Maintainability                   | Follows SOLID principles, easy to extend, well-tested                                                                    | Some best practices followed; moderate ease of maintenance   | Hard to maintain; lacks testing                          | Not maintainable; high technical debt                |
|                                      | Scalability                       | Can handle increasing number of batch types and frequency without performance degradation                                | Minor performance issues with scaling                        | Poor scalability; system slows under load                | Cannot scale; system breaks with load                |
|                                      | Security                          | Handles sensitive data securely; proper authentication/authorization for settings/status API                             | Minor security issues                                        | Significant security risks                               | No security measures; data exposed                   |
| **Testing**                          | Unit & Integration Tests          | Comprehensive test coverage for scheduler, job handlers, API, and React UI                                               | Moderate test coverage; some gaps                            | Minimal testing; many untested paths                     | No tests                                             |
|                                      | Load/Stress Testing               | System validated under high load; multiple jobs run concurrently without failure                                         | Some load testing; minor issues                              | Little testing under load                                | No testing under load; fails easily                  |
| **Documentation**                    | Setup & Usage                     | Clear README with setup, environment, batch type creation, and usage instructions                                        | README exists; minor omissions                               | README incomplete; missing key info                      | No documentation                                     |
